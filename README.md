# Enigma

This project was created as a part of CS61B: Data Structures at UC Berkeley using Java.

This project, developed a software model of the Enigma machine used by the German in the World War II. It involved building a simulator for a generalized version of this machine. This program takes the descriptions of possible initial configurations of the machine and messages to encode or decode (the Enigma algorithms were reciprocal, meaning that encryption is its own inverse operation.)
